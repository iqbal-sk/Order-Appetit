      "### Explanation of the Query Logic and Optimization Techniques:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Date Range Calculation**:\n",
      "   - The code calculates the date range for the last 7 months using `datetime` and `timedelta`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Aggregation Pipeline Stages**:\n",
      "   - **Match Stage for Orders**: Filters the orders based on the `createdAt` field, selecting only those created in the last 7 months.\n",
      "   - **Lookup Stage**: Joins the `orders` collection with the `products` collection using a left outer join on product IDs to get the product details for each order.\n",
      "   - **Unwind Stage**: Deconstructs the array of product details obtained from the lookup stage, allowing access to fields in this document for further operations.\n",
      "   - **Match Stage for Products**: Applies regex to filter products that match \"Mac n Cheese\" in various formats to account for different naming conventions.\n",
      "   - **Group Stage**: Aggregates total sales by product ID and calculates the sum of `total_amount` for each product.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Final Result Formatting**:\n",
      "   - The code formats the final results to display the product name alongside its total sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Optimization Considerations**:\n",
      "   - The use of `$lookup` with proper indexing on the products collection helps to minimize the performance overhead of joins.\n",
      "   - Regular expressions in the match stages enhance flexibility in handling name variations for products related to \"Mac n Cheese\".\n",
      "\n",
      "This code can be executed directly to retrieve sales data for the specified product range.\u001B[00m\n",
