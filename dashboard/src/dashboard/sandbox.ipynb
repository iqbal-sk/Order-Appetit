      "   - Analyze the schemas of the relevant collections to understand the structure and data types.\n",

      "5. **Handle Naming Inconsistencies**:\n",

      "6. **Document Findings**:\n",

      "**Context:** - **Schema Mapping**: Use the output from the `schema_analysis_task`, including strategies for handling naming inconsistencies. - **MongoDB URI**: mongodb://UB_6872023:UB_2024%21@atlas-sql-643e3030d126783c73656b9e-qrodv.a.query.mongodb.net/?ssl=true&authSource=admin&appName=atlas-sql-643e3030d126783c73656b9e - **Database Name**: appetit_db - **Collections**: ['categories', 'delivery_fees', 'locations', 'merchant_logs', 'merchant_settings', 'orders', 'product_categories', 'products', 'stores', 'store_tables', 'users']\n",

      "       - Use the naming variations provided in the schema analysis output to handle inconsistencies in product names.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Construct the Query**:\n",
      "   - Use the mapping to build a MongoDB query or aggregation pipeline that retrieves the required data.\n",
      "   - Implement the strategies for handling naming inconsistencies (e.g., using only the names identified by the `schema_analysis_task`).\n",
      "   - Ensure the query calculates:\n",

      "4. **Optimize the Query**:\n",
      "   - Apply best practices for query optimization to handle large datasets.\n",
      "   - Ensure efficient grouping and summing for each product name.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Handle Data Consistency**:\n",
      "   - Ensure consistent and granular outputs for each product name by incorporating all naming variations.\n",

      "6. **Provide Executable Code**:\n",
      "   - Write clean, executable Python code using PyMongo to connect to MongoDB and execute the query.\n",
      "   - Include all `mac_n_cheese_variations` explicitly in the code.\n",
      "   - The code must return a JSON object with **sales count and sales value for each item (name)**.\n",

      "The aggregation pipeline is designed to retrieve sales data for \"Mac n Cheese\" and its variations over the last 7 months. \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **$match**: The first stage filters orders based on the `createdAt` date to include only those within the last 7 months and checks if the `details.name` matches any of the specified variations of \"Mac n Cheese\".\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **$unwind**: This stage deconstructs the `details` array, creating a separate document for each element in the array, allowing for individual processing of each product detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **$match**: A second match stage ensures that only the details that correspond to the specified product variations are processed.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **$group**: This stage groups the results by product name (`details.name`), summing up the quantities (`qty`) and total sales values (`total_amount`) for each product.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **$project**: Finally, this stage formats the output to include only the desired fields: the product name, total quantity sold, and total sales value, while excluding the default `_id` field.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach ensures that all relevant records are included, handles naming inconsistencies effectively, and provides a clear and structured output for further analysis.\u001B[00m\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Format the Results**:\n",

      "   - Ensure the table includes all necessary fields (e.g., names, quantities, sales values) with clear column labels.\n",
      "   - Maintain consistency in naming conventions as per the schema mapping.\n",
